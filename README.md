# Overview
The program I chose to write in R was one that could show the abilities R had to allow the user to view all sorts of data types. I wrote this because I always enjoyed Scooby Doo as a kid, so I thought it would be a fun data set to look at, but also, it gave a lot of ways to look at the different data. There were ratings, networks, runtime, dates, and all sorts of other data I could sort through and use to see what made the episodes successful, and what made them not so successful. It also allowed me to see what network was the most successful overall.

# Development Environment
I used RStudio for my IDE. I chose R studio because it allows for a lot of easy data viewing in different tabs, without having to, for the most part, switch back and forth between screens. It also allows for easy viewing if any data sets are created, such as scatter plots, or bar charts.

I used the tidyverse library, which gave me access to the Scooby Doo data. In my research of R I found that TidyTuesday does a data set of the week and after some looking around at one that may interest me, I found the Scooby Doo set and determined it would allow for multiple avenues to explore.

# Future Work
- Make plot graphs easier to read
- Bar chart for movies
- Diffent versions of Scooby Doo (such as reboots and others)
